# Motivation

-   What inspired me to build this project was the loneliness that a lot of people have suffered in lockdowns during pandemic. Mental Health has been a pressing issue during these times. People, especially the ones which are not surrounded by friends and family have suffered the most. Small talk is a significant part of creating that social connection and creating this bot would enable people who are seeking companionship to engage in social interactions during these tough times.

# Getting started

1. Setup

    - Clone this repo to your desktop and run npm install to install all the dependencies.
    - You might want to look into package.json and server.js file to make changes to the port you want to use.

2. Usage

    - After you clone this repo to your computer, go to its root directory and run "npm install" inside the root directory to download Server Dependencies.
    - Once the dependencies are installed, you can run "npm start" to start in the root directory as well as the client directory.
    - You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000
